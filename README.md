# Advent of Code

## Diary

The [diary](/diary) contains my thoughts as I go along.

## Running

Add your puzzle inputs to the `src/inputs` folder with a `0`-padded filename, e.g. `01.txt`, `02.txt`.

Run a particular puzzle solution using `cargo run --bin day02`

## Tests

I may add tests. _May_. Run them with `cargo test`.
